Fintech Transactions Analysis – README
 Project Overview

This project analyzes a Fintech transactions dataset using PySpark in Databricks.
The dataset contains customer transaction details such as:

Customer_ID

Payment_Method

Transaction_Amount

Transaction_Date

Transaction_Status

We implemented 9 use cases and built visualizations for better insights.

⚡ Use Cases Implemented

Total Transaction Amount → Sum of all transactions.

Transactions per User → Number of transactions by each customer.

Average Transaction Amount by Payment Method → Spending behavior across Credit/Debit/Net Banking/UPI.

Top 5 Highest Transactions → Largest transactions in the dataset.

Transactions in Last 30 Days → Recent activity tracking.

Daily Totals in Last 30 Days → Trend of daily revenue.

Monthly Totals → Aggregate transactions per month.

Transaction Status Summary → Success, Pending, Failed distribution.

Top 5 Customers by Spending → Most valuable customers.

👉 With this README, anyone reviewing your work will understand what the dataset is, what analysis was done, and what insights can be gained.

Would you like me to also create a Markdown-formatted README file (README.md) that you can directly upload into your Databricks repo?
